    <h1>Celestial Cat</h1>
    <h4>Xinyue Zhou</h4>
    <img src="project1.JPG" width="500" />
    <p>This coaster features shapes of stars, the moon, and a cat, inspired by my Chinese name 'Xinyue,' 
      which poetically describes the eastern sky on the verge of dawn, still adorned with the moon and scattered stars. 
      I chose to include the cat element because I have a deep affection for cats and own them. 
      Thus, this coaster represents a personal collection of elements that are meaningful to me.</p>

    <p>The Puzzle Box is an elegantly designed wooden container that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. 
      Made from plywood, the box features a unique interlocking mechanism. 
      Each side of the box fits seamlessly into the other sides through precise, puzzle-like snaps and slots, 
      showcasing meticulous attention to detail and craftsmanship.</p>

    <h1>Abstract Journey</h1>
    <h4>Lauren Dent, Mira Kaiser, Ava Tartakovsky, Xinyue Zhou</h4>
    <img src="project3.JPG" width="500" />
    <p>This project offers a fresh perspective on classic fairy tales by transforming them into abstract designs. 
      We used a minimalist approach to weave the essence of Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and Cinderella into an engaging visual narrative. 
      Rather than using traditional images, each story is presented through symbolic shapes and forms, 
      inviting the audience to deeply engage with the stories they know and love. 
      Here, this is an image of the Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
