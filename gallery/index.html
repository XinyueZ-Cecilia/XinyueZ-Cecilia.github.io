    <h1>Celestial Cat</h1>
    <h4>Xinyue Zhou</h4>
    <img src="project1.JPG" width="500" />
    <p>This coaster features shapes of stars, the moon, and a cat, inspired by my Chinese name 'Xinyue,' 
      which poetically describes the eastern sky on the verge of dawn, still adorned with the moon and scattered stars. 
      I chose to include the cat element because I have a deep affection for cats and own them. 
      Thus, this coaster represents a personal collection of elements that are meaningful to me.</p>
